			<h3>Course Description</h3>
			<p style = "font-style: italic;"> Teacher: Ms. Emily White </p>
			<p>This course takes a look at Canada’s development from colonies to country. The course views the issues that led the people of eight British North American colonies that existed in 1815 to eventually weave themselves into one nation a mari usque ad mare by the beginning of the Twentieth Century. Why do we have a country, and how did it grow to be the second largest country on Earth? We’ll study all of this, as well as the moral implications of many of the actions different leaders took during the process.</p>

			<p>The course will rely on Internet resources selected by the teacher, along with questions that students will answer to develop a base of knowledge for unit projects and assignments. These major assessments will be the bulk of students’ work and the bulk of graded material. Students will also have opportunities for discussions in scheduled webinars, and for intellectual interaction in written forums.</p>
