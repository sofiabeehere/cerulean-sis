			<h3>Course Description</h3>

			<p style = "font-style: italic;">Teacher: Mr. John Doe</p>

			<p>English 11 course works together with English 12 to develop the skills required for students to graduate from high school and enter either post-secondary education or work. These skills include analytical reading, effective writing, identifying truth when we read it, developing opinions, and presenting ideas and opinions. We must be able to understand nonsense when we read it, and we must be able to recognize sense.</p>

			<p>English 11 students will be challenged to read engaging works of literature and to develop insight into the works. Through the development of writing skills, students will learn to develop their skills to maximize their potential. Also, students will be challenged to develop a thorough understanding of terminology for poetry, drama, short stories, novels, and prose non-fiction. Students will be periodically tested with material patterned after Provincial exam questions, or questions taken from Provincial exams that have been released by the Ministry of Education. These questions are designed to assist students in understanding the governmentâ€™s grading system (a 6 point scale); thus, students will maximize their understanding of the government grading system over a two year period prior to writing the required English 12 Provincial exam. </p>

			<p>The course will rely on the use of resources posted to the website, webinars, personal conversations through skype and telephone, and any other means of suitable communication that promotes learning.</p>
